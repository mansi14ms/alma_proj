WEB SCRAPING USING SELENIUM

The project is based on web-scraping the organization page provided by the user to get the total count of commits and top repositories sorted on basis of fork.

STEP BY STEP GUIDE:

1)	Open a VSCode or any IDE to run your python script.
2)	We have used selenium to use chromedriver, so one needs to install the chromedriver 
  NOTE: Either provide path to Chromedriver or directly use .chrome()
      
3)	Run the python script.
4)	In the terminal, provide the inputs.
Organization name
N-top n forks
M-top M commits of each fork.

 
5) Run the script to test the results.
